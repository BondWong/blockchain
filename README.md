# Bitcoin and Blockchain 

Bitcoin is revolutionary, decentralized crypto currency. It allows everyone around the world to trade without any involvement from traditional third parties such as bank, and governments. The most important thing of the bitcoin hype is that it leads us to a new era -- the internet of trust. The technology behind bitcoin making all this possible is called the blockchain. Bitcoin is just a tip of the iceberg of the application of the blockchain, and we are just at the beginning. To find other possible applications, we should understand the blockchain first.

The purpose of this project is to provide a blog series to help people understand the detail of the bitcoin system. At the beginning of my learning, I struggle to find blogs or posts to educate myself. However, I haven't found any. That's why I decide to write one. 

This article is based on Jian Zhang's wonderful blog series -- ["The Secret of Bitcoin and the Blockchain"](http://www.infoq.com/cn/articles/bitcoin-and-block-chain-part01), a great book -- [Mastering Bitcoin](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032281.do) by Andreas Antonopoulos, and my own understanding of the bitcoin system.
