# Bitcoin and Blockchain part II: Keys and Addresses
Keys, addresses, transactions and blockchain are the fundamental concepts of the bitcoin system. In this part, I will talk about the cryptography in bitcoin, and the generation and usage of address.

## Public-Key Cryptography
Cryptography has been used for thousands of years to hide secret messages. The earliest form of cryptography is called Caesar cipher, a substitution cipher, in which each character of the plain text is substituted by another character to form the cipher text (A cipher is an algorithm used for encryption or decryption). One can find that such ciphers depend on the secrecy of the algorithm. Once the algorithm is known, those encrypted messages can easily be decrypted.

In 19th century, Auguste Kerckhoffs stated in what is later called the Kerckhoffs' principle: A cryptosysm should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. That is to say that the only thing that need to be secure is the key (The key is a secret needed to decrupt the cipertext, which is usually a string of characters). 

As stated in wikipedia, modern cryptography can be divided into several areas of study. The two main ones are symmetric-key cryptography and public-key cryptography, a asymmetric-key cryptography. Before the widely use of Public-key cryptography, symmetric-key cryptography was the main-stream cryptography method. In symmetric-key cryptography, both the sender and receiver share the same key. Sender uses the key to encrypt messages and send the encrypted messages together with the key to receivers so that receivers can use the same key to decrypt the messages. The biggest problem is that you need to have a secure way to get the key to the receiver, which is quiet hard to achieve sometimes. Because if we have a safe way to share the key, we probably don't need to be using encryption at the first place.

In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a groundbreaking paper of public-key cryptography. In public-key cryptography, a public and a private are used. Though they are different, they are mathematically related. A public can only be constructed from its corresponding private key. From the name of keys, we can easily know that a public key can be freely distributed while its paired private key must remain close to others. In such system, the public key is used for encription and the private key is used for decription. 

In 1978, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman found the first public-key algorithm, known as RSA algorithm, the last piece of public-key cryptography. A public-key algorithm is used to create a public key from a random private key, and the reversing calculation from the public key to the private key is impossible. Other algorithms include elliptic curve based algorithm, which bitcoin uses. The development of public-key cryptography makes the digital signature become possible. A digital signature is easy to produce and is very hard for others to forge. The following picture shows the comparison between symmetric-key cryptography and asymmetric-key cryptography.![Alt Text](/images/symmetric-key-and-asymmetric-key.gif)
